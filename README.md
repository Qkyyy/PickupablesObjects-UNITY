Hey everyone. I made a simple system that allows an object to be picked up, dropped and be throwable. It's very simple basis which can be expanded to your particular needs. Feel free to download the project and use the script in your games!

<h2>[28.11.2018] UPDATE</h2>
- Fixed current position of raised object. It will be always in front of the camera.
- Added rotation possibility. You can now rotate raised object before throwing/dropping it.

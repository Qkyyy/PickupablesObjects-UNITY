[28.11.2018] FIX - fixed position of actual object so it doesn't seems so static.


Hey everyone. I made a simple system that allows an object to be picked up, dropped and be throwable. It's very simple basis which can be expanded to your particular needs. Feel free to download the project and use the script in your games!
